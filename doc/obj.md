# Obj

Obj is any object, often a vfg [model](https://vue-generators.gitbook.io/vue-generators/component/model). Note that vfg-display-fields does not change this object.

If schema is given then all the fields in obj that are in the schema are displayed, subject to the options.

If no schema is given then **all** the fields in obj are displayed as strings, as far as possible and subject to the options.
